# Bot-Detection-Task

## Introduction

When Looking at a recent surge of unusual traffic on website. There is always a suspicion of the bot activity on the website but we cannot block all of the suspicious looking requests to our servers because it may lead to losing our original or organic human traffic but not doing anything about this would also mean exposing our website or server to the bots.

So as per my approach we need to find middle grounds for this purpose of tackling this issue such that we only block bots and not restrict the real users from accessing the servers or our website. For this purpose we would need to keep an eye on the "digital Footprints" left by the bots when they use a server or make request to a server following these we can filter out bots among the real users, So i have outlined some of the indicators of bot activity and measures we could take to avoid them.
